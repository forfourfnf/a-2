:bf:beep boop beep
:dad:Oh, yeah. You don't speak, do you?
:bf:Uh... yeah, I do. Have you never heard the lore?

:dad:So, uh... do we sing now?
:bf:I guess so. Those mods you so enjoy - and I suffer through - are only gonna get tougher.
:bf:Y'see what I'm getting at? We can help each other out here.
:dad:Sounds good to me! Hope you're ready for a beatdown...
:bf:...Right.
